## intro 
This project is designed to listen for the events `Liquidate` from [smart contract](https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0x12110Ae316d0AFb33b6dD0A1465437a7D5DB58C6)  and notify users via `XMTP`.   

Event data is indexed and processed using [Envio](https://github.com/OracleXPro/oraclex-contracts-envio).
